# BeetleStudio

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.2.

## Running with [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org)

Execute `npm start` to serve the Angular app using nodejs. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. This command is meant for production and the files in the `dist` directory will have to be recompiled for code changes to be displayed. 

## Development server

Execute `npm start -- -d` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
