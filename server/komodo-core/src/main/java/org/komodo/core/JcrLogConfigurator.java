/**
 * TODO
 *
 * Provides a workaround for a bug in Modeshape's JcrObservationManager (to-be-reported)
 * If the modeshape logger, which uses log4j, is given DEBUG level then all changesets are logged
 * in JcrObservationManager.JcrPropertyEvent (L808). Since the changeEvent.toString contains sets of {..}
 * the logger wrongly interprets these for logging substitution patterns. This falls foul of StringUtil (L188)
 * and throws an {@link IllegalArgumentException}.
 *
 * This series of events has the effect of causing the KSequencers' consumer wrapper to be removed from
 * the modeshape RingBuffer (L466). With the KSequencers class gone, no notifications are ever transmitted
 * back from the JcrEngine and any SynchronousListeners expecting a callback fail.
 *
 * Should be an easy fix ....
